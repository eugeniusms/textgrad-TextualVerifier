[INITIAL LOSS]
The calculation of  b² - 4ac is incorrect: it should be (-7)² - 4 * 3 * 2 = 49 - 24 = 25, 
not 49 + 24 = 73.  Also, the denominator is missing in the final answers for x1 and x2; 
it should be 6 in both cases.

[VERIFIED LOSS]
The core issue across these evaluations is a lack of clear, 
systematic process for calculating the discriminant and applying the quadratic formula, 
leading to sign errors and misinterpretation of the formula itself.  
A robust process should emphasize the following:

1. **Explicit Formula Statement:** 
Always begin by explicitly stating the quadratic formula *and* the discriminant formula separately. 
This reinforces the correct structure and prevents misremembered or combined formulas.

2. **Clear Coefficient Identification:** Explicitly identify the values of a, b, and c, 
*including their signs*, before any calculations. This prevents errors stemming from incorrect substitutions, 
especially with negative coefficients.

3. **Parentheses for Substitution:**  Substitute the values of a, b, and c into the discriminant formula 
*using parentheses*. This is crucial for maintaining the correct order of operations and 
preventing sign errors, particularly when squaring negative numbers or multiplying by negative coefficients. 
For example, write b² as (-7)² not -7².  Similarly, write -4ac as -4*(a)*(c).

4. **Stepwise Calculation of -4ac:** Calculate -4ac as a separate, labeled step before combining it with b². 
This clarifies the process and reduces the risk of sign errors during the combined calculation.

5. **Stepwise Discriminant Calculation:** Calculate the discriminant (b² - 4ac) step-by-step, 
showing each operation clearly. This creates a clear audit trail and reduces the chance of errors.

6. **Square Root After Discriminant Calculation:** Calculate the square root of the discriminant 
*only after* the discriminant has been fully evaluated. This reinforces the correct order of 
operations within the quadratic formula.

7. **Verification (if possible):**  If tools are available, verify the equation and discriminant 
calculation to catch any remaining errors.

By following these steps, you create a systematic, error-resistant process that promotes clear 
reasoning and a deeper understanding of the quadratic formula.  The emphasis should be on understanding 
*why* each step is taken, not just on getting the correct numerical answer.
