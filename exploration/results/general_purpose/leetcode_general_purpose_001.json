    "Step 1": "We need to find the median of two sorted arrays in O(log(m+n)) time. This suggests a binary search approach.  The median is the middle element (or average of two middle elements) in the sorted combined array.  We don't need to actually merge and sort the arrays.  We can find the median by finding the correct partitioning point in each array.",
    "Step 2": "Let's consider `nums1` with length `m` and `nums2` with length `n`.  We want to partition `nums1` into two parts at index `partitionX` and `nums2` at index `partitionY` such that all elements to the left of the partitions (including the elements at the partitions) are less than or equal to all elements to the right of the partitions.  Furthermore, we want the total number of elements to the left of both partitions to be equal to (or very close to) the total number of elements to the right of both partitions.  Specifically, we want:\n\n`partitionX + partitionY = (m + n + 1) // 2`",
    "Step 3": "We can perform a binary search on the smaller array to find the appropriate partition point.  Let's assume `m <= n`.  We search for `partitionX` within `nums1`.\n\n`low = 0`\n`high = m`\n\nIn each step of the binary search:\n`partitionX = (low + high) // 2`\n`partitionY = (m + n + 1) // 2 - partitionX`",
    "Step 4": "We need to check if our partitions are correct. We define `maxLeftX` and `minRightX` for `nums1` and `maxLeftY` and `minRightY` for `nums2`.\n\nIf `maxLeftX <= minRightY` and `maxLeftY <= minRightX`, we've found the correct partitions.\n\nIf `maxLeftX > minRightY`, we need to decrease `partitionX` (and increase `partitionY`), so we set `high = partitionX - 1`.\n\nIf `maxLeftY > minRightX`, we need to increase `partitionX` (and decrease `partitionY`), so we set `low = partitionX + 1`.",
    "Step 5": "Once we find the correct partitions, the median is:\n`max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY)` if `m + n` is odd\n`(max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY) + min(minRightX, minRightY)) / 2.0` if `m + n` is even\n\nWe need to handle edge cases where `partitionX` or `partitionY` are 0 or `m` or `n` respectively. We'll use `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` in these cases."
