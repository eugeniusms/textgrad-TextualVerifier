    "Step 1": "The energy-time uncertainty principle states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the uncertainty in energy, \u0394t is the uncertainty in time, and \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10^-16 eV s).  To clearly distinguish two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in their energies.  We can approximate the uncertainty in time as the lifetime of the states. Since we have two states with different lifetimes, we should consider the shorter lifetime, which corresponds to a larger energy uncertainty.",
    "Step 2": "The shorter lifetime is 10^-9 s.  We can use this to calculate the minimum energy difference needed to resolve the two levels: \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(2\u0394t). Plugging in the values, we get \u0394E \u2265 (6.582 x 10^-16 eV s) / (2 * 10^-9 s) = 3.291 x 10^-7 eV.",
    "Step 3": "Comparing this minimum energy difference with the given options, we see that only option A, 10^-4 eV, is greater than 3.291 x 10^-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference must be at least 10^-4 eV to clearly resolve the two energy levels."
