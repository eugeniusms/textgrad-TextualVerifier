Rating Meaning:

-1: Bad (Wrong)
Wrong, Hard to verify, Contains gibberish, Contains off-topic text or non-sequiturs, 
Suggests attempting something that is unreasonable for this problem, Derails the conversation, 
Leads the solution into an immediately obvious dead end or makes it go in circles

0: Okay
Okay options sound like something a person would say, they just don't contribute 
anything of essence to the conversation. They're reasonable, verifiably correct, and appropriate, 
but they're also redundant, stalling, or just don't add any value.

1: Great
Correct, verifiable, appropriate, insightful
