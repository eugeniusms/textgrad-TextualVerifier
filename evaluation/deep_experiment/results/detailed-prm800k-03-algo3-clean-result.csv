# Answer

9901</Step>
","<Step>Let's find $99^2$.  We can rewrite 99 as $(100-1)$.  Therefore, $99^2 = (100-1)^2 = 100^2 - 2(100)(1) + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801$.</Step>
<Step>We have $99^2 + 99 + 1$.  From the previous step, $99^2 = 9801$.  So, we have $9801 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 100 = 9901$.</Step>
<Step>Let's consider $99^2 + 99 + 1$.  This looks like the expansion of $x^2 + x + 1$, which is part of the formula for the sum of a geometric series.  If we let $x=99$, we can rewrite the expression as $99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1} = \frac{99^3 - 1}{98}$.
We already computed $99^2 = 9801$.  Then $99^3 = 99 \cdot 9801 = (100-1)(9801) = 980100 - 9801 = 970299$.
Therefore, $99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{970299 - 1}{98} = \frac{970298}{98} = 9901$.
Alternatively, since we already calculated $99^2 = 9801$, we have $99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 100 = 9901$.</Step>
<Step>Since we already calculated $99^2 = 9801$, we can observe that $99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + (99+1) = 99^2 + 100 = 9801 + 100 = 9901$.</Step>
<Step>Right. So, $99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 100 = 9901$.
