(Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)","<Step>There are a total of $7$ people, so there are $7!$ ways to seat all of them with no restrictions.</Step>
<Step>Yes, and let's make sure that they are not sitting next to each other.</Step>
<Step>That's a good idea. There are $7$ seats, so there are $7$ ways for the first person to be seated.</Step>
<Step>This leaves us with $7 - (3+2) = 2$ people left to seat.</Step>
<Step>First, let's take the case where Rosa is two seats from Pierre.</Step>
<Step>That means that she is either one seat to the left or one seat to the right of Pierre.</Step>
<Step>And there are two ways to seat Thomas: he can be in the seat next to Pierre, or in the seat next to Rosa.</Step>
<Step>Yes, and there is only one way for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas to sit in these seats.</Step>
<Step>From the first case, there are two seats for Thomas to sit in. From the second case, there is only one seat for Thomas to sit in. So we have three cases total.</Step>
<Step>And for case 2), there is 1 seat for Thomas and then 4! for the other people.</Step>
<Step>For case 2), there are 1 seat for Thomas and then 4! for the other people.</Step>

<Step>Wait, we're not done yet. We need to add the two cases together.</Step>
<Step>Right. $96+48=144$.</Step>
<Step>Ok, so there are $144$ ways to seat the 7 people.

# Answer

144</Step>
","<Step>Since we are arranging the 7 people around a circular table, and rotations are considered the same, there are $(7-1)! = 6! = 720$ ways to seat them without any restrictions.</Step>
<Step>Now, let's consider the restriction that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other.  We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.  Let $N$ be the total number of arrangements ($6! = 720$). Let $A$ be the set of arrangements where Pierre and Rosa sit together, $B$ be the set of arrangements where Pierre and Thomas sit together, and $C$ be the set of arrangements where Rosa and Thomas sit together.  We want to find $N - |A \cup B \cup C|$.
If Pierre and Rosa sit together, we can treat them as a single unit.  Then we have 5 other people plus the Pierre/Rosa unit, making 6 units to arrange around the circular table. This can be done in $(6-1)! = 5! = 120$ ways.  Within the Pierre/Rosa unit, they can switch places, so there are $2 \cdot 5! = 240$ such arrangements. Thus, $|A| = |B| = |C| = 240$.
If Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we treat them as one unit.  We then have 4 other people plus the Pierre/Rosa/Thomas unit, making 5 units to arrange around the circular table in $(5-1)! = 4! = 24$ ways. Within their unit, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways. So there are $6 \cdot 4! = 144$ such arrangements. Thus, $|A \cap B| = |A \cap C| = |B \cap C| = 144$.
If all three sit together, we have already calculated this as $6 \cdot 4! = 144$, so $|A \cap B \cap C| = 144$.
By the principle of inclusion-exclusion,
$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| = 3(240) - 3(144) + 144 = 720 - 432 + 144 = 432$.
Therefore, the number of ways they can sit such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is $720 - 432 = 288$.</Step>
<Step>We've correctly calculated the total number of arrangements as $(7-1)! = 6! = 720$.  The approach using inclusion-exclusion is also correct.  We have $|A| = |B| = |C| = 2 \cdot 5! = 240$ and $|A \cap B| = |A \cap C| = |B \cap C| = 3! \cdot 4! = 6 \cdot 24 = 144$, and $|A \cap B \cap C| = 3! \cdot 4! = 144$.  So, $|A \cup B \cup C| = 3(240) - 3(144) + 144 = 720 - 432 + 144 = 432$.  Thus, the number of arrangements where no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is $720 - 432 = 288$.</Step>
<Step>We have 4 other people besides Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  We arrange these 4 people around the circular table in $(4-1)! = 3! = 6$ ways.  Now, we want to place Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas such that no two of them are adjacent.  We can think of the 4 other people as creating 4 spaces between them where we can place Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  We need to choose 3 of these 4 spaces, which can be done in $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways.  Then, we can arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in these chosen spaces in $3! = 6$ ways.  So, there are $3! \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot 3! = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 144$ ways to seat the 7 people such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together.</Step>
<Step>We have 4 other people besides Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas. We arrange these 4 people around the circular table in $(4-1)! = 3! = 6$ ways.  There are now 4 spaces between these people where we can place Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  Since no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit together, we must choose 3 of these 4 spaces to place them.  This can be done in $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways.  Once we have chosen the 3 spaces, we can arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in $3! = 6$ ways.  Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the 7 people such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is $3! \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot 3! = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 144$.</Step>

Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the 7 people such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is $3! \times \binom{4}{3} \times 3! = 6 \times 4 \times 6 = 144$.</Step>
<Step>There are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in the chosen spaces.</Step>
<Step>There are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in the chosen spaces.  So, we have $3! = 6$ ways to seat the 4 other people and $\binom{4}{3} \times 3! = 4 \times 6 = 24$ ways to seat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in the available spaces. Thus, there are $6 \times 24 = 144$ ways to seat the 7 people such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together.</Step>
