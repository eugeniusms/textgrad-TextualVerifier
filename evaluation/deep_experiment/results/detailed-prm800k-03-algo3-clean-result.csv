problem_-1811521160547483057,"In how many ways can $7$ people sit around a round table if no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other? (Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)","<Step>There are a total of $7$ people, so there are $7!$ ways to seat all of them with no restrictions.</Step>
<Step>Yes, and let's make sure that they are not sitting next to each other.</Step>
<Step>That's a good idea. There are $7$ seats, so there are $7$ ways for the first person to be seated.</Step>
<Step>This leaves us with $7 - (3+2) = 2$ people left to seat.</Step>
<Step>First, let's take the case where Rosa is two seats from Pierre.</Step>
<Step>That means that she is either one seat to the left or one seat to the right of Pierre.</Step>
<Step>And there are two ways to seat Thomas: he can be in the seat next to Pierre, or in the seat next to Rosa.</Step>
<Step>Yes, and there is only one way for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas to sit in these seats.</Step>
<Step>From the first case, there are two seats for Thomas to sit in. From the second case, there is only one seat for Thomas to sit in. So we have three cases total.</Step>
<Step>And for case 2), there is 1 seat for Thomas and then 4! for the other people.</Step>
<Step>For case 2), there are 1 seat for Thomas and then 4! for the other people.</Step>
<Step>So, for case 2) we have $4*4!=96$ total ways. Let's add them up.</Step>
<Step>Wait, we're not done yet. We need to add the two cases together.</Step>
<Step>Right. $96+48=144$.</Step>
<Step>Ok, so there are $144$ ways to seat the 7 people.

# Answer

144</Step>
","<Step>We can fix one person's position at the table. Then, the remaining 6 people can be seated in $6!$ ways. Since rotations are considered the same, this accounts for all possible distinct arrangements of the 7 people around the circular table.</Step>
<Step>Let's consider the complementary approach. We will subtract the number of seating arrangements where at least two of the three are together from the total number of arrangements, $6!$.  To do this effectively, we'll need to consider cases where two are adjacent and where all three are adjacent.</Step>
<Step>The total number of ways to seat the 7 people around the circular table, treating rotations as identical, is $6!$.  We will proceed by subtracting the disallowed arrangements from this total.</Step>
<Step>Aside from Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, there are $7-3=4$ other people.</Step>
<Step>Consider the cases where exactly two of the three are seated together.  There are 3 ways to choose which two are adjacent.  Treat the adjacent pair as a single block.  This block can be arranged internally in $2!$ ways.  We now have 5 entities to arrange around the table (the block plus the remaining 4 people).  This can be done in $(5-1)! = 4!$ ways.</Step>
<Step>There are 3 ways to choose which two of the three are adjacent.  Treat the adjacent pair as a single block.  This block can be arranged internally in $2!$ ways.  We now have 5 entities to arrange around the table (the block plus the remaining 4 people).  This can be done in $(5-1)! = 4!$ ways.</Step>
<Step>If Pierre and Rosa are together, we can treat them as a single unit.  There are two possible positions for Thomas relative to this unit: one on Pierre's side and one on Rosa's side.</Step>
<Step>If all three are seated together, we can treat them as one block.  This block can be arranged internally in $3! = 6$ ways.  The block and the remaining 4 people form 5 entities to be arranged around the circular table, which can be done in $(5-1)!=4!$ ways.  Thus, there are $3!4!$ arrangements where all three are adjacent.</Step>
<Step>We've considered the case where exactly two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are seated together.  Now consider the case where all three are adjacent.  This forms a block of 3 people, which can be internally arranged in $3!$ ways.  This block and the remaining 4 people make 5 units to arrange around the table, which can be done in $(5-1)! = 4!$ ways.  So there are $3!4!$ ways for all three to be seated together.  This is a separate case from the arrangements where only two are adjacent.</Step>
<Step>When two of the three are together, there are $3$ choices for the pair.  Consider the pair a single unit, which can be ordered in $2!$ ways.  Placing this unit and the third person from the group of three creates two gaps into which the remaining four people can be seated.  The number of ways to arrange the remaining four people is $4!$.  Thus, there are $3 \cdot 2! \cdot 2 \cdot 4!$ such arrangements.</Step>
<Step>If Pierre and Rosa are together, they can be arranged in $2!$ ways within their block.  This leaves 3 possible positions for Thomas (since he cannot be next to Pierre or Rosa).  The remaining 4 people can be arranged in $4!$ ways.  So there are $2! \cdot 3 \cdot 4!$ arrangements in this case.</Step>
<Step>The number of ways to seat the three together is $3! \times 4! = 144$.</Step>
<Step>To obtain the number of disallowed arrangements, we sum the number of arrangements where exactly two of the three are adjacent and the number of arrangements where all three are adjacent.</Step>
<Step>The disallowed arrangements total $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 4! \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 4! = 288 + 144 = 432$.</Step>
<Step>We calculated $3 \times 2 \times 4! \times 2 = 288$ ways for exactly two of the three to be together, and $3! \times 4! = 144$ ways for all three to be together.  These are disjoint cases, so we add them to get $288 + 144 = 432$ disallowed arrangements.  Subtracting this from the total $6! = 720$ arrangements gives $720 - 432 = 288$ allowed arrangements.
