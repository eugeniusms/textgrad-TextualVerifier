problem_-7991849741346505023,Compute $99^2+99+1$ in your head.,"<STEP>What's the square of 99?</STEP>
<STEP>The result is $99*100+99$, which is $9801$.</STEP>
<STEP>What about $99^2+99+1$?</STEP>
<STEP>So, $99^2+99+1=9900+1=9901$.</STEP>
<STEP>Right. So, $99^2+99+1=9901$.

# Answer

9901</STEP>
","<VERIFIED>```$99^2 = (100-1)^2 = 100^2 - 2(100)(1) + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801$.
```
</VERIFIED>
<VERIFIED>```
$99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901$.
```
</VERIFIED>
<VERIFIED>```
$99^2 + 99 + 1 = (99+1)^2-99 = 100^2 - 99 = 10000 - 99 = 9901$.
```
</VERIFIED>
<VERIFIED>```$99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901$.
```
</VERIFIED>
<VERIFIED>```
$99^2 + 99 + 1 = (100-1)^2 + (100-1) + 1 = 10000 - 200 + 1 + 100 - 1 + 1 = 9901$.
