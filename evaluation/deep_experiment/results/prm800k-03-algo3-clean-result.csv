problem_5477234828985715978,Compute $99^2+99+1$ in your head.,"<Step>What's the square of 99?</Step>
<Step>The result is $99*100+99$, which is $9801$.</Step>
<Step>What about $99^2+99+1$?</Step>
<Step>So, $99^2+99+1=9900+1=9901$.</Step>
<Step>Right. So, $99^2+99+1=9901$.

# Answer

9901</Step>
","<Step>We want to compute $99^2$.</Step>
<Step>We can rewrite $99^2$ as $99 \cdot 99 = 99 \cdot (100 - 1) = 99 \cdot 100 - 99 = 9900 - 99 = 9801$.</Step>
<Step>Now, we can substitute the value we found for $99^2$ into the expression $99^2 + 99 + 1$.  This gives us $9801 + 99 + 1$.  We can then compute $9801 + 99 = 9900$, and finally $9900 + 1 = 9901$.</Step>
<Step>Thus, $99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901$.</Step>
<Step>Therefore, $99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901$.
