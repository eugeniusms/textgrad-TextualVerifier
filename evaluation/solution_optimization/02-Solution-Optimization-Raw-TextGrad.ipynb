Mathematically, this is expressed as:\\n\\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\\n\\nWe are given the lifetimes of the two states, which can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt).

Think step by step before answering.\\n\\nTwo quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\\n\\n\\nA) 10^-11 eV\\nB) 10^-8 eV\\n\\nC) 10^-9 eV\\nD) 10^-4 eV in the conversation:\\n\\n<FEEDBACK>The core issue pointed out by the evaluator is the conflation of lifetime with the uncertainty in time (Δt).  The solution needs to explicitly address the relationship between the lifetime of a state and the uncertainty in its energy.  Here\\'s how the variable can be improved:\\n\\n1. **Clarify the relationship between lifetime and Δt:**  The solution should explain *why* the lifetime can be used as Δt in the uncertainty principle.  This could involve referencing relevant physics principles or providing a more intuitive explanation. For example, the solution could mention that the lifetime represents the characteristic timescale over which the state exists, and thus can be considered a measure of the uncertainty in when the state decays, which relates to the uncertainty in time.  A more rigorous approach would be to connect the lifetime to the exponential decay of the state and explain how this relates to the time uncertainty.\\n\\n2. **Consider both lifetimes:** The current solution focuses only on the shorter lifetime.  While it\\'s true that the shorter lifetime is the limiting factor, the solution should acknowledge the presence of two lifetimes and explain why the shorter one is chosen for the calculation.  It might be beneficial to briefly discuss how the longer lifetime would affect the calculation if used.  This demonstrates a more complete understanding of the problem.\\n\\n3. **Improve clarity and precision:** Phrases like \"can be considered\" are vague. The solution should use more precise language to explain the relationship between lifetime and Δt.  For instance, instead of saying \"We can consider the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) as the limiting factor,\" the solution could say \"The shorter lifetime (10^-9 s) determines the maximum energy resolution, as it corresponds to the largest uncertainty in energy according to the energy-time uncertainty principle.\"\\n</FEEDBACK>\\n\\n']\n",

Mathematically, this is expressed as:\\n\\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\\n\\nThe lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty in the time of its decay.  A shorter lifetime implies a greater uncertainty in when the decay occurs, and thus a larger Δt.  Since we want to distinguish between two energy levels, we need to consider the state with the shorter lifetime, as this will correspond to the larger energy uncertainty and thus the minimum resolvable energy difference.  In this case, the shorter lifetime is 10⁻⁹ s.  We can use this lifetime as a measure of the uncertainty in time (Δt) because it represents the characteristic timescale over which the state exists.\\n\\nGiven the two lifetimes of 10⁻⁹ s and 10⁻⁸ s, we choose the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) as it determines the maximum energy resolution, corresponding to the largest uncertainty in energy according to the energy-time uncertainty principle.
