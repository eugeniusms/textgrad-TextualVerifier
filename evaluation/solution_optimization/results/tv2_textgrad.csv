202,"The number of possible combinations of attributes is the product of the number of possible values for each attribute. In this case, we have 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24 possible combinations of attributes.

Since the class can take on 3 possible values, for each combination of attributes, there are 3 possible examples.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of different examples is 24 * 3 = 72.

Answer: C",C,MMLU-ML,machine_learning,"Let's define the terms:
* **Attributes:** These are the features of the machine learning problem.  There are four attributes.
* **Class:** This is the label or category assigned to each example.
* **Example:**  An ""example"" in machine learning consists of a specific combination of attribute values along with its corresponding class label.

The attributes have 3, 2, 2, and 2 possible values each. The number of possible combinations of attributes is calculated by multiplying the number of values for each attribute: 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.

The class has 3 possible values.  Since each of the 24 attribute combinations can be associated with any of the 3 class values, the total number of different examples is the product of the number of attribute combinations and the number of class values.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of different examples is 24 * 3 = 72.

Answer: C","Let's define the terms:
* **Attributes:** These are the features of the machine learning problem. There are four attributes in this case.
* **Class:** This is the label or category assigned to each example.
* **Example:** An ""example"" in machine learning consists of a specific combination of attribute values along with its corresponding class label.

The attributes have 3, 2, 2, and 2 possible values each. Since each attribute can take on a certain number of values independently, we multiply the number of values for each attribute to find the total number of attribute combinations: 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.  So, there are 24 unique combinations of attributes.

The class has 3 possible values. Because each of the 24 attribute combinations can be paired with any of the 3 class values, we multiply 24 by 3 to get the total number of distinct examples: 24 * 3 = 72.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of different examples is 72.

Answer: C","The number of possible combinations of attribute values can be calculated using the fundamental counting principle.  Since there are 3 choices for the first attribute, 2 for the second, 2 for the third, and 2 for the fourth, the total number of attribute combinations is the product of these choices: 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24.

Each of these 24 attribute combinations can be paired with any of the 3 possible class values.  Therefore, the total number of different examples is the product of the number of attribute combinations and the number of class values: 24 * 3 = 72.

Answer: C","There are four attributes with 3, 2, 2, and 2 possible values respectively, and a class attribute with 3 possible values.  The total number of different examples is the product of the number of possible values for each attribute, including the class attribute.  Therefore, the total number of examples is 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 72.

Answer: C","There are four attributes with 3, 2, 2, and 2 possible values respectively.  There is also a class attribute with 3 possible values.
The total number of different examples is the product of the number of possible values for each attribute, including the class attribute.
Therefore, the total number of examples is 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 72.
