2,"Here's how we can determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3:

1. **Reaction 1:** trans-Cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O) reacts with methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr), a Grignard reagent.  Grignard reagents add to the carbonyl carbon, forming an alcohol.  This adds one carbon atom (from the methyl group) to the molecule.  So, product 1 has 9 + 1 = 10 carbon atoms.

2. **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (the secondary alcohol) is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC). PCC is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols to ketones.  The number of carbon atoms remains the same. So, product 2 still has 10 carbon atoms.

3. **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (the ketone) is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane, which is more commonly known as dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (or Corey-Chaykovsky reagent). In DMSO at elevated temperature, this reagent reacts with ketones to form epoxides. This reaction adds one carbon atom to the molecule. So, product 3 has 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.

1,"The energy-time uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to h-bar/2, where h-bar is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).  Mathematically, this is expressed as:

ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2

We are given the lifetimes of the two states, which can be considered as the uncertainty in time (Δt).  We want to find the minimum energy difference (ΔE) that allows us to resolve the two energy levels.  This means we need ΔE to be greater than the uncertainty introduced by the finite lifetime of the states.

We can consider the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) as the limiting factor for resolving the energy levels.  Using the energy-time uncertainty principle:

ΔE ≥ ħ/(2*Δt)

ħ ≈ 6.582 * 10^-16 eV*s
Δt = 10^-9 s

ΔE ≥ (6.582 * 10^-16 eV*s) / (2 * 10^-9 s)
ΔE ≥ 3.291 * 10^-7 eV

This means the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.291 * 10^-7 eV to resolve the two energy levels.  Comparing this value to the given options:

A) 10^-11 eV - Too small
B) 10^-8 eV - Too small
C) 10^-9 eV - Too small
D) 10^-4 eV - Large enough

Only option D satisfies the condition ΔE > 3.291 * 10^-7 eV.

ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2

The lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty in the time of its decay.  A shorter lifetime implies a greater uncertainty in when the decay occurs, and thus a larger Δt.  Since we want to distinguish between two energy levels, we need to consider the state with the shorter lifetime, as this will correspond to the larger energy uncertainty and thus the minimum resolvable energy difference.  In this case, the shorter lifetime is 10⁻⁹ s.  We can use this lifetime as a measure of the uncertainty in time (Δt) because it represents the characteristic timescale over which the state exists.

Given the two lifetimes of 10⁻⁹ s and 10⁻⁸ s, we choose the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) as it determines the maximum energy resolution, corresponding to the largest uncertainty in energy according to the energy-time uncertainty principle.  Using the uncertainty principle:

ΔE ≥ ħ/(2*Δt)

Δt = 10⁻⁹ s

ΔE ≥ (6.582 * 10⁻¹⁶ eV*s) / (2 * 10⁻⁹ s)
