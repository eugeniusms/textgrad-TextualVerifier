```
</VERIFIED>
<VERIFIED>```$(99+1)^2 = 99^2 + 2(99) + 1$, so $99^2+99+1 = (99+1)^2 - 99 = 100^2 - 99 = 10000 - 99 = 9901$.
```
</VERIFIED>
<VERIFIED>```$99^2+99+1 = (99+1)^2 - 99 = 100^2 - 99 = 10000 - 99 = 9901$.

$99^2 + 99 + 1 = (100-1)^2 + 99 + 1 = (10000 - 200 + 1) + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 101 = 9902$
$99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901$
