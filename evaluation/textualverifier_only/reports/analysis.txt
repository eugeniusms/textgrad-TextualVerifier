STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------
Stuart-Maxwell Test:
  H₀: Marginal distributions are homogeneous (no systematic bias)
  H₁: Marginal distributions are not homogeneous (systematic bias exists)

Significance Levels:
  p < 0.001 (***): Highly significant evidence of bias
  p < 0.01  (**):  Strong evidence of bias
  p < 0.05  (*):   Significant evidence of bias
  p ≥ 0.05  (ns):  No significant evidence of bias

Effect Size Interpretation (Cramér's V):
  < 0.1: Negligible effect
  0.1-0.3: Small effect
  0.3-0.5: Medium effect
  > 0.5: Large effect

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION: SYSTEMATIC BIAS CORRECTION NEEDED
• Multiple versions show significant rating asymmetries
• Consider implementing bias correction mechanisms
• Investigate root causes of systematic rating shifts
• Use Version 3 as benchmark for balanced transitions

Quality Assurance Guidelines:
• Monitor transition matrices regularly for bias development
• Set up alerts for p-values < 0.05 in production systems
• Consider periodic recalibration if systematic bias emerges
• Use Version 3 configuration as the gold standard
