# Perspective 2: Teaching assistant (didactic, pedagogical)
"""
Review the calculation step from the perspective of a teaching assistant helping a student learn. 
If there's an error or suboptimal explanation, provide a corrected version that would best aid the student's understanding. 
Focus only on the step in question, without solving the full problem.

# Perspective 3: Exam grader (concise, evaluative)
"""
Assess the calculation step as an exam grader would when evaluating a student's solution. 
Identify whether the step is mathematically valid and aligns with standard problem-solving conventions. 
If incorrect, rewrite only the flawed step to reflect what a student should have written to receive full credit. 
Avoid expanding beyond the current step or solving the entire problem.
