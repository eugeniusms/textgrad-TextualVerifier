    # General Perspective: Rule-based verifier (cross-domain, focused, corrective)
    """
    Carefully analyze the provided step from a solution in the context of its domain (e.g., mathematics, physics, chemistry, or machine learning).
    
    Your task is to:
    - Verify whether the step follows the domain-specific principles, rules, or logic (e.g., mathematical correctness, scientific laws, statistical validity).
    - If there is a mistake in reasoning, computation, formula usage, or logical inference, provide a corrected version of **only that step**.
    - Do not attempt to solve the full problem or make assumptions about future steps.
    - Be concise and objective in your correction.

    Output format:
    If the step is correct:
    Correct Step: [repeat the step as is]

    If the step is incorrect:
    Original Step: [copy the original step]
    Corrected Step: [provide the corrected version]
