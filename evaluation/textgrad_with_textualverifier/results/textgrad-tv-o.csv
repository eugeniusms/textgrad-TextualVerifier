395,MMLU-CP,college_physics,"Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD. Think step by step before answering.

The emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ (Z = 3, A = 7) is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are

A) decreased by a factor of 49
B) decreased by a factor of 81
C) decreased by a factor of 9
D) increased by a factor of 9",C,"The energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom are given by
$$E_n = -\frac{Z^2}{n^2} E_0$$
where $E_0 = 13.6$ eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen, $Z$ is the atomic number, and $n$ is the principal quantum number.

The wavelengths of the spectral lines are given by the Rydberg formula:
$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = RZ^2 \left(\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2}\right)$$
where $R$ is the Rydberg constant, $Z$ is the atomic number, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states, respectively.

For hydrogen, $Z=1$, so
$$\frac{1}{\lambda_H} = R \left(\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2}\right)$$
For doubly ionized lithium, Li++, $Z=3$, so
$$\frac{1}{\lambda_{Li}} = R(3^2) \left(\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2}\right) = 9R \left(\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2}\right)$$
Comparing the two equations, we have
$$\frac{1}{\lambda_{Li}} = 9 \frac{1}{\lambda_H}$$
$$\lambda_{Li} = \frac{\lambda_H}{9}$$
Thus, the wavelengths in the Li++ spectrum are decreased by a factor of 9 compared to the hydrogen spectrum.

Answer: C","The final answer should be  $\lambda_{Li} = \frac{\lambda_H}{9}$. The solution correctly derives this.  There are no errors.

From the equations for hydrogen and Li++:
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda_H} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right) $$
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda_{Li}} = 9R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right) $$
Substituting the first equation into the second gives:
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda_{Li}} = 9 \frac{1}{\lambda_H} $$
Taking the reciprocal of both sides:
$$ \lambda_{Li} = \frac{\lambda_H}{9} $$

406,MMLU-CP,college_physics,"Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD. Think step by step before answering.

An object is thrown horizontally from the open window of a building. If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)

A) 4.9 m
B) 19.6 m
C) 9.8 m
D) 10.0 m",B,"The object is thrown horizontally, so the initial vertical velocity is 0 m/s. The object is subject to gravity, which causes it to accelerate downwards at 9.8 m/s². We are given that the time of flight is 2.0 s. We can use the following kinematic equation to find the vertical displacement, which corresponds to the height from which the object was thrown:

Δy = v₀t + (1/2)at²

where:
Δy is the vertical displacement (height)
v₀ is the initial vertical velocity (0 m/s)
t is the time of flight (2.0 s)
a is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s²)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Δy = (0 m/s)(2.0 s) + (1/2)(-9.8 m/s²)(2.0 s)²
Δy = 0 + (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²)
Δy = -19.6 m

Since the displacement is negative, it indicates a downward direction. The height is the absolute value of the displacement, which is 19.6 m.

Answer: B
","The solution correctly identifies the initial vertical velocity as 0 m/s and uses the correct kinematic equation. It also correctly plugs in the values for time and acceleration due to gravity. However, it makes an error in the units during the calculation.  The unit of seconds squared should be applied to the time, not mixed with the acceleration's unit. It should be (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²) not (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s).  This leads to an incorrect final answer.
