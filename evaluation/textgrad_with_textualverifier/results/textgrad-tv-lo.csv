406,MMLU-CP,college_physics,"Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD. Think step by step before answering.

An object is thrown horizontally from the open window of a building. If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)

A) 4.9 m
B) 19.6 m
C) 9.8 m
D) 10.0 m",B,"The object is thrown horizontally, so the initial vertical velocity is 0 m/s. The object is subject to gravity, which causes it to accelerate downwards at 9.8 m/s². We are given that the time of flight is 2.0 s. We can use the following kinematic equation to find the vertical displacement, which corresponds to the height from which the object was thrown:

Δy = v₀t + (1/2)at²

where:
Δy is the vertical displacement (height)
v₀ is the initial vertical velocity (0 m/s)
t is the time of flight (2.0 s)
a is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s²)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Δy = (0 m/s)(2.0 s) + (1/2)(-9.8 m/s²)(2.0 s)²
Δy = 0 + (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²)
Δy = -19.6 m

Since the displacement is negative, it indicates a downward direction. The height is the absolute value of the displacement, which is 19.6 m.

Answer: B
","The solution correctly identifies the initial vertical velocity as 0 m/s and uses the correct kinematic equation. It also correctly plugs in the values for time and acceleration due to gravity. However, it makes an error in the units during the calculation.  The unit of seconds squared should be applied to the time, not mixed with the acceleration's unit. It should be (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²) not (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s).  This leads to an incorrect final answer.
","<VERIFIED>The calculation correctly identifies the error in the units within the intermediate step.  The unit analysis should be (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²) resulting in -19.6 m, not (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s). However, the final answer of -19.6 m is correct, and the solution correctly interprets the negative sign as indicating downward direction and gives the correct height of 19.6 m.  Therefore, the final answer is correct, despite the described error in the intermediate step. The calculation should focus on the final answer's correctness. The solution *correctly* calculates (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²) and gets -19.6m. The provided calculation is incorrect in stating there is a unit error.
