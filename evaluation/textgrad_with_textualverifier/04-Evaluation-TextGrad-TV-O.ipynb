The object is subject to gravity, which causes it to accelerate downwards at 9.8 m/sÂ². We are given that the time of flight is 2.0 s. We can use the following kinematic equation to find the vertical displacement, which corresponds to the height from which the object was thrown:\\n\\nÎ”y = vâ‚€t + (1/2)atÂ²\\n\\nwhere:\\nÎ”y is the vertical displacement (height)\\nvâ‚€ is the initial vertical velocity (0 m/s)\\nt is the time of flight (2.0 s)\\na is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/sÂ²)\\n\\nPlugging in the values, we get:\\n\\nÎ”y = (0 m/s)(2.0 s) + (1/2)(-9.8 m/sÂ²)(2.0 s)Â²\\nÎ”y = 0 + (-4.9 m/sÂ²)(4.0 sÂ²)\\nÎ”y = -19.6 m\\n\\nSince the displacement is negative, it indicates a downward direction.

It also correctly plugs in the values for time and acceleration due to gravity. However, it makes an error in the units during the calculation.  The unit of seconds squared should be applied to the time, not mixed with the acceleration\\'s unit. It should be (-4.9 m/sÂ²)(4.0 sÂ²) not (-4.9 m/sÂ²)(4.0 s).

While the final magnitude of the answer is correct, the intermediate steps have incorrect units. Specifically, the evaluation states: \"It should be (-4.9 m/sÂ²)(4.0 sÂ²) not (-4.9 m/sÂ²)(4.0 s)\".  The variable should be corrected to ensure the units are consistent throughout the calculation.  This will improve the correctness of the reasoning and avoid potential confusion, even if the final answer happens to be numerically correct.  Double-check each step of the calculation to make sure the units are being handled correctly, and simplify the units alongside the numerical values.\\n</FEEDBACK>\\n\\n']\n"
