Be super concise. </LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT>\\n\\n<LM_INPUT> The object is thrown horizontally, so the initial vertical velocity is 0 m/s. The object is subject to gravity, which causes it to accelerate downwards at 9.8 m/s². We are given that the time of flight is 2.0 s. We can use the following kinematic equation to find the vertical displacement, which corresponds to the height from which the object was thrown:\\n\\nΔy = v₀t + (1/2)at²\\n\\nwhere:\\nΔy is the vertical displacement (height)\\nv₀ is the initial vertical velocity (0 m/s)\\nt is the time of flight (2.0 s)\\na is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s²)\\n\\nPlugging in the values, we get:\\n\\nΔy = (0 m/s)(2.0 s) + (1/2)(-9.8 m/s²)(2.0 s)²\\nΔy = 0 + (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²)\\nΔy = -19.6 m\\n\\nSince the displacement is negative, it indicates a downward direction. The height is the absolute value of the displacement, which is 19.6 m.\\n\\nAnswer: B\\n </LM_INPUT>\\n\\n<LM_OUTPUT> The solution correctly identifies the initial vertical velocity as 0 m/s and uses the correct kinematic equation. It also correctly plugs in the values for time and acceleration due to gravity. However, it makes an error in the units during the calculation.  The unit of seconds squared should be applied to the time, not mixed with the acceleration\\'s unit. It should be (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²) not (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s).

Think step by step before answering.\\n\\nAn object is thrown horizontally from the open window of a building. If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown?

While the final magnitude of the answer is correct, the intermediate steps have incorrect units. Specifically, the evaluation states: \"It should be (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s²) not (-4.9 m/s²)(4.0 s)\".  The variable should be corrected to ensure the units are consistent throughout the calculation.  This will improve the correctness of the reasoning and avoid potential confusion, even if the final answer happens to be numerically correct.  Double-check each step of the calculation to make sure the units are being handled correctly, and simplify the units alongside the numerical values.\\n</FEEDBACK>\\n\\n']\n"
