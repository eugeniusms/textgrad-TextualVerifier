The output is used as response from the language model\\n\\nHere is the feedback we got for solution to the math question in the conversation:\\n\\n<FEEDBACK>The language model evaluation identifies a crucial mistake in the calculation within the quadratic formula.  Specifically, the discriminant (the part under the square root, b² - 4ac) was incorrectly calculated as positive 73 when it should be 25. The provided solution missed the negative sign on 'b' in the discriminant calculation, leading to (-7)² - 4 * 3 * 2 being incorrectly evaluated as 49 + 24 = 73, instead of the correct 49 - 24 = 25.  This error propagates through the rest of the solution, leading to incorrect final values for x1 and x2.  Correcting this discriminant calculation to 25 will allow the solution to arrive at the correct final values of x = 2 and x = 1/3.  Additionally, the final solutions are missing the denominator (division by 6) which should be included to arrive at the correct final answer.\\n</FEEDBACK>\\n\\n\"]\n",
