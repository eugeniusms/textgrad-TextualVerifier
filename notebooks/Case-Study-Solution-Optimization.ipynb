The output is used as response from the language model\\n\\nHere is the feedback we got for solution to the math question in the conversation:\\n\\n<FEEDBACK>The language model evaluation points out several errors in the solution:\\n\\n1. **Incorrect Sign in the Quadratic Formula:** The solution uses `+4ac` instead of the correct `-4ac` within the square root of the quadratic formula. This mistake leads to the wrong discriminant and ultimately incorrect solutions.  The feedback here is to carefully review the quadratic formula and ensure the correct signs are used in all calculations.\\n\\n2. **Missing Denominator in Final Solutions:** The final solutions for `x1` and `x2` are presented without the denominator (division by 6). The feedback is to remember that the entire expression (7 ± √(b² - 4ac)) is divided by 2a, and this division must be maintained throughout the simplification process until the final solutions are obtained.  Explicitly write the division by 6 in each step to avoid this error.\\n\\n3. **Incorrect Simplification:** Due to the initial sign error, the simplification within the square root is incorrect, leading to √73.  The feedback is to double-check the calculations within the square root after correcting the sign error in the formula.  Ensure that each arithmetic operation is performed accurately.\\n</FEEDBACK>\\n\\n']\n",
