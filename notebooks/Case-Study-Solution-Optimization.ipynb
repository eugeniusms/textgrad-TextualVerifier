The output is used as response from the language model\\n\\nHere is the feedback we got for solution to the math question in the conversation:\\n\\n<FEEDBACK>The language model evaluation points out two key areas for improvement: clarity in coefficient substitution and explicit handling of signed values.  Here\\'s how these points translate into actionable feedback for improving the solution:\\n\\n1. **Break Down Coefficient Substitution:** The solution jumps directly to substituting `a`, `b`, and `c` into the quadratic formula.  This can lead to errors if the values are not correctly identified in the first place.  The feedback here is to explicitly state the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` *before* substituting them. For example, add lines like \"From the equation, we identify a = 3, b = -7, and c = 2.\"  This makes the substitution step much clearer and easier to verify.\\n\\n2. **Show Explicit Calculations with Signs:** The evaluation highlights the risk of sign errors, especially within the square root. The feedback is to expand the calculations within the discriminant (the part under the square root) step by step.  Instead of directly writing `(-7)^2 + 4(3)(2)`, show the calculation as `(-7)^2 + 4 * (3) * (2) = 49 + 24 = 73`. This makes it clear how the signs are being handled and reduces the chance of making a mistake.  Similarly, explicitly show the division by `2a` as division by `2 * 3 = 6`.\\n\\n3. **Correct the Final Answer:** The final solutions are missing the denominator.  Emphasize the importance of carrying through the entire calculation, including the division by `2a`, to arrive at the correct final answer. The solutions should be presented as `x1 = (7 + √73) / 6` and `x2 = (7 - √73) / 6`.  This addresses the missing denominator in the presented solution.\\n</FEEDBACK>\\n\\n']\n",
