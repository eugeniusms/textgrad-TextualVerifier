A simple proportion doesn't capture this complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we can use a proportion as a starting point, it only provides a rough estimate *if* the additional shirts don't significantly affect the sunlight and airflow each shirt receives.  Let's calculate that proportional estimate:\n",
      "\n",
      "25 shirts / 1 hour = 30 shirts / t hours\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving for t:  t = 30/25 = 1.2 hours (72 minutes)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this assumes the drying rate remains constant. In reality, if there's enough sunlight and space for all 30 shirts, adding 5 more might not change the drying time substantially.  The environmental conditions are often the limiting factor, not the number of shirts (within reasonable limits).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, a more realistic estimate would consider that the drying time for 30 shirts will likely be close to the drying time for 25 shirts (1 hour), perhaps with a few additional minutes at most, assuming similar drying conditions.  It's unlikely that the extra 5 shirts would add a full 12 minutes as suggested by the direct proportion.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more accurate estimate would require information about the available drying space, sunlight intensity, temperature, and humidity.  Observing the drying time for a smaller batch of shirts under the same conditions could provide a better baseline.  Therefore, the drying time for 30 shirts is likely to be approximately 1 hour, but could vary depending on environmental factors.\n"
